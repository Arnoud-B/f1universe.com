	  <p>Dear loyal users of F1Universe.com,</p>
	  <p>We would like to thank you for using our site, maybe for many years already. Alex and I (Arnoud) have enjoyed bringing you this service since 1999. However, times change and lives change - we are currently at stages in our lives where we cannot spend enough time on F1Universe.com anymore to keep the service running smoothly. This is why we have decided to close the site for now. Perhaps we will be back in the future, perhaps not.</p>
	<p>With the rise of <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> we trust that you will be able to find alternatives to our service, and we hope that you will continue to enjoy Formula 1 in many seasons to come. God speed!</p>
	<p>Arnoud &amp; Alex,<br />
	F1Universe.com.</p>
	<p><em>PS. This is for everyone who has sent feedback: it was very comforting to read all your warm wishes. It makes it even harder for us to say goodbye, but it is very good to know that our service was appreciated so much by the people we created it for! Thanks so much! </em></p>
